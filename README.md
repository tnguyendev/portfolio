# Portfolio

This is my portfolio! I talk a little bit about myself, showcase some of my recent works, and provide a way for people to contact me! I think it's a cute, simple theme. I'm not a fan of long scrolling portfolios, so I wanted to keep it short!

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

Figuring out the contact form was pretty challenging. I went with a shorter route that just included formspree. It doesn't really look that amazing, and the functionality of it feels meh (having the user not completely reach you by email, and instead it's a third party), but it works I guess!
